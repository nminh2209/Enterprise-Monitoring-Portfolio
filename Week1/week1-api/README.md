| **AKS Internal** | `week1-api-service:3000` | Internal cluster | Microservices, advanced orchestration |
| **AKS External** | `http://135.171.192.18/api/*` | Public HTTP | External API access via ingress |

### 📋 Next Steps

- **Step 4**: Deploy React frontend to AKS (same cluster)
- **Step 5**: Implement authentication (OpenID/custom)
- **Step 6**: Setup custom domain with HTTPS

This ingress setup demonstrates advanced Kubernetes networking: external load balancing, URL rewriting, and path-based routing for microservices architecture.

This deployment demonstrates core DevOps practices: containerization, container registries, and cloud deployment with Infrastructure as Code principles.
